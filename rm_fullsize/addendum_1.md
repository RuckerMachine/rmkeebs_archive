# RM Fullsize: Hotswap Addendum Part 1

## Layout Choice

Due to how the hotswap sockets are soldered onto the PCB, not all of the sockets can be installed at the same time. Depending on your layout of choice, you may need to remove or replace some sockets.

If you want to use a 7u spacebar: First check to see if your spacebar has the ability to use a stabilizer for a 6.5u spacebar. Some spacebars do, some don’t. If yours does, no changes are needed. If your spacebar requires a stabilizer for a 7u spacebar, then you’ll need to remove the socket that blocks the mounting hole. It’s labeled on the PCB with the text “Remove for 7u – SW102”

If you want to use split backspace switches: The 2u stabilizer mounting holes interfere with the sockets for the two split backspace switches, so they aren’t installed. You’ll need to solder them into place. They are labeled on the PCB with the text “SW34” and “SW35”

If you want to use split plus or split enter switches on the tenkey: The socket for the 2u enter key interferes with one of the 1u sockets, and the socket for the 2u plus key interferes with one of the 1u sockets. You must remove the 2u socket(s) and move them into the 1u position(s). These sockets are labled on the PCB with the text “SW80″, SW122”, “SW123”, and “SW112”
